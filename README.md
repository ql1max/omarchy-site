# Omarchy

Beautiful, Modern & Opinionated Linux by DHH.

See https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy for more.

## News

Add posts as Markdown under `content/news/YYYY/MM/post-slug.md`. A post may
start with YAML front matter containing `title`, `date`, `author`, `author_url`,
and `description`; only the title is required, either there or as the first `#`
heading. Images stored beside the post are published with it. Regenerate the
pages under `news/` with:

    bin/build-news

## The Manual

The pages under `manual/` are generated from the authoritative markdown chapters
in the [omarchy repo](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/tree/HEAD/manual).
Regenerate them (then commit the result) with:

    bin/build-manual

It needs `gem install kramdown kramdown-parser-gfm` and imagemagick on first run. Pass a local
checkout to build without hitting GitHub: `bin/build-manual ../omarchy/manual`.
